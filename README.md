# 2d-game-using-python
The aim of this project is to build a 2D arcade like game from scratch in Python, the goal being for the project to be as lightweight open source resource wise as possible. The core of the game, is PyGame , a set of Python modules designed for game development, which was used for tasks such blitting images on the screen or moving the said images. All powerups are generated based on the playerâ€™s style of playing as well as the history of previous powerups. The player spaceship is controlled either via mouse or keyboard and the enemy spaceships have a predefined movement in the first level of the game, while being controlled by an AI module in the latter level. This project is based on using python language and simulation to apply programming and logic skills to the development of a video game, mainly most of the code is written in python except some game function that uses C#,tools that may be used other than pygames are PYGLET,VISUAL STUDIO CODE.
The end product is a two levels game, the goal of the player being to destroy all the enemy space ships, picking up buffs or debuffs along the way, encountering intelligent enemies in the latter level of the game. 

IMPORTANT MESSAGE-  before downloading the code make sure that you have following things on your system:
1.latest version of python.(100% required)
2. pygames installed.(100% required)
3.any code editor.(such as visual studio code or sublime editor)

now just goto CODE and download zip file.

ENJOY
